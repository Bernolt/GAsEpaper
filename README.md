# Prototype for multistate sequence of jobs optimization

Application looks to produce a GA based optimization for how to pick-up different jobs to be worked-out in a machine.
There are different variables to be considered (Multistate system, weighted transitions enforced, variable operation conditions, etc.)

It is envisaged to be used in environments with variable energy cost.
