# Prototype for multistate sequence of jobs optimization

Application looks to produce a GA based optimization for how to pick-up different jobs to be worked-out in a machine.
There are different variables to be considered (Multistate system, weighted transitions enforced, variable operation conditions, etc.)

It is envisaged to be used in environments with variable energy cost.

Some improvements like segment penalties and transitions pending on length of previous states were considered.

Cases like those from a previous paper were carried out. Their names go from C3 to C6.
